# AssetTracker

**TODO: Add description**

## Installation

Until it's available in Hex, the package can be installed from github
by adding `asset_tracker` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {
      :asset_tracker,
      git: "https://github.com/rm-rf-etc/asset-tracker.git",
      ref: "9f9a15f6a3a6af08783f78f86d6c076550b20f39"
    }
  ]
end
```
