**TODO: Add description**

## Installation

Until it's available in Hex, the package can be installed from github
by adding `ex_sqlite_market_db` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {
      :ex_sqlite_market_db,
      git: "https://github.com/rm-rf-etc/asset-tracker.git",
      ref: "<commit hash goes here>"
    }
  ]
end
```
